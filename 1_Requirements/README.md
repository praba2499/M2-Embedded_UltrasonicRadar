**REQUIREMENTS**

**INTRODUCTION:**

Radar systems have a number of Defence as well as civil applications. Air traffic control uses radars to track air crafts on the ground and in the air, and to guide planes for smooth landings. Police use radars to detect the speed of passing vehicles. Geologists use radars to map the Earth and other planets. Military uses these for surveillance. Meteorologists use radars to track storms, hurricanes and tornadoes. The list is endless.

**OBJECTIVE:**

The sensor can be easily interfaced with any micro controller. Output from the sensor is in a frame of nine bytes.This micro controller based ultrasonic radar circuit demonstrates the working of a radar system. It uses ultrasonic waves to detect an object and measure its distance and angular position, and displays the same on a 20×4 LCD screen.

**4W’s and 1H’s:**

**Who**

- For Pilot,Navy,Air forces can used with ultrasonic radar.
- Air forces can easily access with navigation.
- Navy can also helpful with this system.

**What**

- The radar can detect locations between 2 to 4 meters and display the values of object.
- The object detection is performed inside an angle of 180 degrees. 
- The motion sensor that covers this angle uses a stepper motor.

**When**

- Loop control. Roll diameter, tension control, winding and unwind. 
- Liquid level control.Robotic sensing. Stacking height control.Vehicle detection for car wash and automotive assembly. 
- Irregular parts detection for hoppers and feeder bowls.

**Where**

- Ultrasonic sensors are most commonly used for measuring the level of body in water. 
- such as in a tank, well, pit, lake, or another body of liquid. 
- Ultrasonic level sensors can also be used to measure liquid in non-linear containers.

**How**

This program can be executed in a system which has Linux/Mac or Windows operating system.

**Swot Analysis:**

**Strength**

They DO NOT measure farther than about 70 meters. They DO NOT measure at very high repetition rates. Due to speed of sound limitations the fastest rate is 200 Hz at a max distance of about 24 inches.

**Weakness**

limited testing distance, inaccurate readings, and inflexible scanning methods. All of these drawbacks, however, can be mitigated and even overcome with the right NDT tools and techniques.

**Opportunities**

This receiver processes the received signal and provides such information as the presence of a target, distance, position (moving or stationary) or speed, which is displayed on a display unit.

**Threats**

Temperature fluctuation affects the speed of an ultrasonic sensor's sound waves. As temperature increases, the sound waves travel faster to and from the target. While the target may not have shifted, it will seem to the sensor that the target is closer.

**Components:**

- Ultrasonic distance sensor
- Dc motor drive IC L239D
- LCD panel
- LED dial
- Buffer
- OPTO interrupt sensor circuit
- Sensor interfacing circuit
- Motor
- ATMEGA 328
