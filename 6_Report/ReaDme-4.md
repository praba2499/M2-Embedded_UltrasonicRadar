**INTRODUCTION:**

Radar systems have a number of Defence as well as civil applications. Air traffic control uses radars to track air crafts on the ground and in the air, and to guide planes for smooth landings. Police use radars to detect the speed of passing vehicles. Geologists use radars to map the Earth and other planets. Military uses these for surveillance. Meteorologists use radars to track storms, hurricanes and tornadoes. The list is endless.

**OBJECTIVE:**

The sensor can be easily interfaced with any micro controller. Output from the sensor is in a frame of nine bytes.This micro controller based ultrasonic radar circuit demonstrates the working of a radar system. It uses ultrasonic waves to detect an object and measure its distance and angular position, and displays the same on a 20×4 LCD screen.

**Who**

- For Pilot,Navy,Air forces can used with ultrasonic radar.
- Air forces can easily access with navigation.
- Navy can also helpful with this system.

**What**

- The radar can detect locations between 2 to 4 meters and display the values of object.
- The object detection is performed inside an angle of 180 degrees. 
- The motion sensor that covers this angle uses a stepper motor.

**When**

- Loop control. Roll diameter, tension control, winding and unwind. 
- Liquid level control.Robotic sensing. Stacking height control.Vehicle detection for car wash and automotive assembly. 
- Irregular parts detection for hoppers and feeder bowls.

**Where**

- Ultrasonic sensors are most commonly used for measuring the level of body in water. 
- **such as in a tank, well, pit, lake, or another body of** liquid. 
- Ultrasonic level sensors can also be used to measure liquid in non-linear containers.

**How**

This program can be executed in a system which has Linux/Mac or Windows operating system.
